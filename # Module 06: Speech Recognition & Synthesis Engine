## Description
Module 06 implements the **Speech Recognition and Synthesis engine**. It converts spoken user commands into text for processing by other modules and generates natural speech responses from AI outputs.

## Inputs
- Audio/speech data from microphones or voice sources
- Processed text or commands from previous modules
- Speech model parameters and configurations

## Outputs
- Recognized text from user speech
- Synthesized audio responses
- Logs & status updates

# FUNCTION 1: Load Speech Models
FUNCTION Load_Speech_Models(Recognition_Path, Synthesis_Path):
    RECOG_MODEL = Read_Model_From_File(Recognition_Path)
    SYNTH_MODEL = Read_Model_From_File(Synthesis_Path)
    LOG "Speech models loaded successfully"
    RETURN RECOG_MODEL, SYNTH_MODEL

# FUNCTION 2: Speech to Text
FUNCTION Recognize_Speech(Audio, RECOG_MODEL):
    TEXT = RECOG_MODEL.Convert(Audio)
    LOG "Recognized text: " + TEXT
    RETURN TEXT

# FUNCTION 3: Text to Speech
FUNCTION Synthesize_Speech(Text, SYNTH_MODEL):
    AUDIO = SYNTH_MODEL.Generate(Text)
    LOG "Synthesized speech generated"
    RETURN AUDIO
