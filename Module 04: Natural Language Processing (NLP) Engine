# Module 04: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engine

Module 04: Natural Language Processing Engine for understanding and generating human language

## Extended Description

Module 04 implements a **Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine** within the AI system. It enables the AI to **understand, interpret, and generate human language**, including text input from users, commands, and contextual data.

This module is responsible for **language parsing, intent recognition, sentiment analysis, and text generation**. It ensures that user interactions are accurately interpreted and transformed into actionable data for subsequent modules.

Key responsibilities include:
- Parsing user input and extracting intents
- Performing sentiment analysis and entity recognition
- Generating responses or structured data for downstream modules
- Logging all NLP processes and results for monitoring and debugging

Module 04 acts as the **communication layer** of the AI, bridging human language with system operations.

## Inputs
- User text or voice commands (converted to text)
- Processed data from previous modules
- NLP model parameters and dictionaries

## Outputs
- Parsed and structured data
- Sentiment and intent labels
- Generated responses or commands
- Logs & status updates

## Pseudo-code
* ‚Üê yahan manually type karo ```

# FUNCTION 1: Parse User Input
FUNCTION Parse_Input(Text):
    TOKENS = Tokenize(Text)
    INTENT = Detect_Intent(TOKENS)
    ENTITIES = Extract_Entities(TOKENS)
    LOG "Input parsed: Intent=" + INTENT
    RETURN INTENT, ENTITIES

# FUNCTION 2: Sentiment Analysis
FUNCTION Analyze_Sentiment(Text):
    SENTIMENT_SCORE = Sentiment_Model.Predict(Text)
    LOG "Sentiment score: " + SENTIMENT_SCORE
    RETURN SENTIMENT_SCORE

# FUNCTION 3: Generate Response
FUNCTION Generate_Response(INTENT, ENTITIES, CONTEXT):
    RESPONSE = Response_Model.Generate(INTENT, ENTITIES, CONTEXT)
    LOG "Generated response: " + RESPONSE
    RETURN RESPONSE

# MAIN EXECUTION FLOW
START:
    USER_TEXT = RECEIVE_USER_INPUT()
    
    INTENT, ENTITIES = Parse_Input(USER_TEXT)
    SENTIMENT = Analyze_Sentiment(USER_TEXT)
    
    RESPONSE = Generate_Response(INTENT, ENTITIES, SYSTEM_CONTEXT)
    
    SEND_TO_OUTPUT_HANDLER(RESPONSE)
    LOG "NLP processing completed successfully."
